Report for the second part of homework basecamp4.

In this part app-secret-env was deployed.

Then app-multicontainer was deployed to K8S. 
app-multicontainer was exposed using service type LoadBalancer.
After that this app was exposed outside the cluster using the service type NodePort

It definitely was not so easy for the first time, so here is another asciinema with some 
troubleshooting steps - https://asciinema.org/a/K1u3cXJ51jfhq9OAEqof13dY6

The next step was to get access from the outside of cluster without using LoadBalancer. 
I am not sure I understood the task properly, so I used Ingress for this. It is not the service type LoadBalancer
but loadbalancer (nginx) was used anyway.
